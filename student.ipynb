    "## Introduction\n",
    "Motor vehicle crashes remain a significant public safety concern in many cities across the globe. Understanding the underlying causes of traffic accidents is essential for improving road safety, optimizing traffic regulations, and informing policy decisions. With the increasing availability of open data, machine learning offers powerful tools for discovering patterns and predicting outcomes that can lead to actionable insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses publicly available crash, vehicle, and people datasets from the City of Chicago to develop a predictive model. The goal is to analyze a wide range of factors — including vehicle information, road conditions, and driver characteristics — to identify the primary contributory cause of each accident. By modeling this problem, we aim to support traffic safety stakeholders in better understanding crash dynamics and designing targeted interventions.\n"

    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "Motor vehicle accidents remain a persistent and costly public safety issue in urban centers. Every year, thousands of traffic accidents result in injuries, fatalities, and significant economic losses. Understanding the primary contributory causes of these crashes can help policymakers, urban planners, and safety boards implement targeted interventions to reduce accidents.\n",
